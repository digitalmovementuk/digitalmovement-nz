/**
 * Post-build: sitemap.xml, plus assertions that the build is actually
 * crawlable.
 *
 * The sitemap is derived from the HTML files the build emitted, not from a
 * hand-kept list. That is deliberate: the sitemap previously registered for
 * digitalmovement.uk drifted out of sync and ended up 404ing, which left
 * Google with zero discovered pages. A list generated from build output
 * cannot drift — if a route stops being built, it leaves the sitemap in the
 * same commit.
 *
 * vite-react-ssg writes flat files (dist/about.html, dist/services/seo.html)
 * and produces dist/404.html directly. GitHub Pages resolves /about to
 * about.html and returns 200, and serves 404.html with a real 404 status for
 * anything it has no file for — which is what makes unmatched paths behave
 * correctly instead of the old `cp dist/index.html dist/404.html` trick that
 * returned 404 for every real page.
