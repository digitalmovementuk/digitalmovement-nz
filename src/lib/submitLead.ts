/**
 * The one place a lead leaves this site.
 *
 * Both forms previously called preventDefault() and flipped straight to a
 * success state. Nothing was ever sent: every enquiry the site received was
 * shown "thanks, we'll be in touch" and silently discarded. This module
 * exists so that can't happen again — a form may only show success when a
 * submission actually succeeded.
 *
 * Destinations are configured at build time and are deliberately NOT secret:
 * this is a static site on GitHub Pages, so anything referenced here ships to
 * the browser in plain text. Never put a GoHighLevel private token, an SMTP
 * password, or any other credential in this file.
 *
 * Two destination kinds are supported, and every one configured gets a copy:
 *
 *   VITE_WEB3FORMS_KEYS  Comma-separated Web3Forms access keys. Each key
 *                        delivers to the one inbox it was registered to —
 *                        Web3Forms' cc field is a paid feature, so reaching
 *                        two people means two keys, not one key with two
 *                        addresses. Enquiries must reach both
 *                        martey@digitalmovement.com.au and
 *                        alex@digitalmovement.uk, hence the fan-out.
 *   VITE_LEAD_ENDPOINT   Optional generic JSON webhook (e.g. a GoHighLevel
 *                        inbound webhook) kept so the CRM can be added later
 *                        without touching the forms.

/**
 * Digital Movement's own PHP lead handler, shared with digitalmovement.uk and
 * digitalezahnärzte.de. This is the primary destination — it needs no signup
 * and no third-party account, which is why the site sat unconfigured for so
 * long waiting on a Web3Forms key that never arrived.
 *
 * Its contract is specific and unforgiving, so it gets its own sender rather
 * than reusing the generic webhook path:
 *
 *  - The URL is the subdomain ROOT. There is no /send.php — that path 404s and
 *    cost a sister site every lead it received until it was found.
 *  - Content-Type MUST be text/plain;charset=utf-8. That keeps the request a
 *    CORS *simple* request and avoids a preflight entirely.
 *  - `consent` is REQUIRED. Omit it and the handler rejects the submission.
 *  - `company_website` is the honeypot the handler expects — send it empty.
 *  - The Origin must be on the handler's allowlist or it answers 403. Both
 *    digitalmovement.co.nz and www. are allowlisted as of 2026-07-31.
 *
 * Never use mode:"no-cors" here: the opaque response would report success
 * while the server silently rejected the lead.
